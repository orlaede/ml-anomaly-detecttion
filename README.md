#Anomaly Detecttion

Some anomalies detecttions technics with machine learning

The main go for this repository is listing some technics to detect anomalies using Machine Learning.

- forecast_timeseries_lstm_anomaly.ipynb - present the case os LSTM for forecat, that use of prededifed fraction (ratio) to select the number of data point  with maximun error and determine the anomaly threshold.
